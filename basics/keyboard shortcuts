You're likely already familiar with some of the basic shortcuts, which are inherited from your operating system. Shortcuts like Ctrl + S to save, Ctrl + C to copy, and Ctrl + V to paste all work in VS Code.

But there's a few that are application specific and can still level up your productivity. It's worth noting that some of these shortcuts may differ by operating system.

For example, Shift + Alt + F will run your configured formatter (such as prettier, for a JavaScript project) on the currently opened file.

Or Ctrl + Shift + F (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + F (Mac), to search the text contents of all the files in your workspace. Then Ctrl + Shift + H (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + H (Mac), if you want to run a find-and-replace.

If you need to remove a line, Ctrl + Shift + K (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + K (Mac), will delete it.

Need some extra room for all your code? Ctrl + B (Windows), or Cmd + B (Mac), will hide the sidebar - which has the file list and extensions menu.

Or maybe you just can't see your code? Ctrl + plus (Windows), or Cmd + plus (Mac), will increase the scaling of the editor, and Ctrl + minus (Windows), or Cmd + minus (Mac), will decrease it.

Finally, if you forget any of these shortcuts, you always have Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows), or Cmd + Shift + P (Mac), which opens the command palette for you to select whatever you may need.

With this knowledge, and maybe a little practice, you are well on your way to becoming a VS Code power user.
